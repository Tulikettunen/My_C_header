This is my own collection of usefull reusable functions for C programming.

NOTE! 
This is a very incomplate set of functions and not all of them are finnishesd, optimised or safe for all usages. If you use any of the functions, be cautios and check the code and it's purpose first.
Changes, updades and modifications are likely as I get better and find better solutions, using this repo as a code base or "library" for your projects might not be recommended since the "library" is volatile due to being in developmenet state.
